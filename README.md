# AI Detector

A simple tool to detect whether a given text is AI-generated or human-written. This MVP uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library to classify text.

## Features
- **AI Detection**: Detects if a given text is likely generated by an AI model (e.g., GPT).
- **Confidence Score**: Provides a confidence score for the prediction.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple Python function for quick integration.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: 
  - Improved layout with a menu bar for easy navigation
  - Progress bar for batch processing
  - Copy results to clipboard
  - Export results to CSV
  - Clear functionality to reset interface
- **Settings Dialog**: Users can now configure security settings and UI preferences.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security events and analysis results.
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple text files in a selected directory.

## Security Features
- Input validation and sanitization.
- Rate limiting and file type restrictions.
- Comprehensive logging of security events and analysis results.
- Configurable limits for text length and file size.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/se7enb2st/AI-Detector.git
   cd anti-ai-detection
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch

### How It Works
- The tool uses the roberta-base-openai-detector model from Hugging Face, which is fine-tuned to detect text generated by OpenAI models like GPT. The model analyzes the input text and returns:
- Label: AI or Human
- Confidence Score: A value between 0 and 1 indicating the model's confidence in the prediction.

### User Interface Features
1. **Text Input Tab**:
   - Enter text directly in the text area
   - Analyze text with a single click
   - Clear input and results
   - View results with confidence score

2. **File Input Tab**:
   - Select and analyze individual text files
   - Clear file selection and results
   - View detailed analysis results

3. **Batch Processing Tab**:
   - Process multiple text files in a directory
   - Progress bar shows analysis status
   - Copy results to clipboard
   - Export results to CSV format
   - Clear all results and reset interface

### Example Output:
```
Prediction: AI (Confidence: 0.92)
Prediction: Human (Confidence: 0.85)
