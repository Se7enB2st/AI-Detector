# Anti AI Detection (MVP)

A simple tool to detect whether a given text is AI-generated or human-written. This MVP uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library to classify text.

---

## Features
- **AI Detection**: Detects if a given text is likely generated by an AI model (e.g., GPT).
- **Confidence Score**: Provides a confidence score for the prediction.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple Python function for quick integration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/se7enb2st/Anti-AI-Detection.git
   cd anti-ai-detection
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch

### How It Works
- The tool uses the roberta-base-openai-detector model from Hugging Face, which is fine-tuned to detect text generated by OpenAI models like GPT. The model analyzes the input text and returns:
- Label: AI or Human
- Confidence Score: A value between 0 and 1 indicating the model's confidence in the prediction.
- Example Output:
 ```
Prediction: AI (Confidence: 0.92)
Prediction: Human (Confidence: 0.85)
